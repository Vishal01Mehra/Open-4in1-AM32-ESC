The project is named `4in1-mini`, not after the repo. Renaming it would break
the fab archive names, the release assets and the website board art.

## Rules

Identical in every OpenDrone board repo. Do not edit here; edit the template.

- **Never text-edit** `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb` or `.kicad_dru`. Use KiCad, or
  kicad-skip / the pcbnew API for scripted changes. `.kicad_pro` is JSON and may
  be edited directly for metadata.
- **Metadata yes, connections no.** An agent may write BOM and documentation
  fields (MPN, Manufacturer, LCSC, Cost, Datasheet, text variables). An agent
  may not change nets, wiring, routing, placement, footprint assignment, or any
  value that changes the circuit.
- **Close KiCad before any write to a KiCad file.** KiCad caches library tables
  at process start and overwrites files on save.
- **Reuse before you draw.** Check the `OpenDrone` library and its
  `PARTS-USED.md` first. If the part is there we have already sourced,
  footprinted and shipped it, and its symbol links to the exact committed
  datasheet: place it from `OpenDrone`. Draw a new part only when the catalogue
  has nothing that fits, and import it with `easyeda2kicad` from its LCSC
  number. Pulling a newer catalogue is a deliberate, reviewed submodule commit.
- **One person holds a board layout at a time.** KiCad files do not merge. Say
  on Discord that you are taking it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **ERC and DRC clean before every pull request.** Commands below.

## Environment

```sh
# schematic and board checks
kicad-cli sch erc --exit-code-violations hardware/4in1-mini.kicad_sch
kicad-cli pcb drc --schematic-parity --refill-zones --exit-code-violations hardware/4in1-mini.kicad_pcb

# netlist, for scripted analysis
kicad-cli sch export netlist --format kicadsexpr -o /tmp/4in1-mini.net hardware/4in1-mini.kicad_sch
```

Shared scripts (renders, STEP export, packaging art) live in
`OpenDrone-Scripts`; board-specific scripts live in `hardware/tools/`.

## Architecture

Four independent channels share one power input and one connector. Per channel:
an **AT32F421G8U7** (Cortex-M4, QFN-28) drives an **NSG2065Q** three-phase
half-bridge gate driver, which drives six **DOY180N03T** MOSFETs, two per phase.
One channel is drawn once in `ESC.kicad_sch` and instantiated four times.

Current sensing is **board level, not per motor**: an INA186A3IDCKR at 100 V/V
across a single 0.2 mOhm 2512 shunt in the +BATT feed. That gives 20 mV/A and
165 A full scale against a 3.3 V ADC, reported as `/CURR`. The 30x30 sibling
uses two shunts in parallel and reads twice the current at half the sensitivity.

## Connectors and I/O

Betaflight Standard:

| Pin | Net | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | +BATT | Battery positive |
| 2 | GND | Ground |
| 3 | /CURR | Current sense telemetry, INA186 output |
| 4 | unconnected | See below |
| 5 | /M1 | DShot, channel 1 |
| 6 | /M2 | DShot, channel 2 |
| 7 | /M3 | DShot, channel 3 |
| 8 | /M4 | DShot, channel 4 |

Pin 4 is the dedicated telemetry pin in the Betaflight 8-pin standard and is
intentionally left unconnected: telemetry rides the motor signal lines over
bidirectional extended DShot instead.

## Firmware

[AM32 first needs a boatloader loaded using an ST-LINK
(AM32_F421_BOOTLOADER_PB4_V19.hex)
](https://github.com/am32-firmware/AM32) firmware is flashed and configured
in-browser at [am32.ca](https://am32.ca). Works with Betaflight and any other
DShot-capable flight controller.

## Layout rules

Bulk decoupling on +BATT and GND exists on the PCB without matching schematic
symbols. That is a deliberate board-only bank. Do not run
update-from-schematic without checking what it would delete.

## Revisions

| Rev | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Rev3.3 | 2026-08-25 | Export OpenESC-20x20-rev3.3. Silkscreen rebranded OpenDrone -> incutec for export restriction reasons on flagging anything containing 'Drone'. First Incutec production run. |
| Rev3.2 | 2026-08-22 | Export OpenESC-20x20-rev3.2. Matched input network at the current-sense amplifier (R89/R90 1k, C40/C41 100n 50V, C42 1u) against the high-side common-mode feedthrough. |
| Rev3.1 | 2026-08-14 | Export `20x20_ESC_Rev3.1`. Bulk bank: 22 x 10 uF 1206 on +BATT/GND, 21 of them PCB-only (19 CL refs absent from the schematic, CL50/CL51 doubled). Board setup moved to the line standard. |
| Rev3 | 2026-08-11 | Input clamp diodes D1-D3 removed, TVS diodes offer no protection when rail voltage is this close to the MOSFET Vds. |
| Rev2-20x20 | 2026-06-05 | Validated build. 15 pieces ordered by Incutec. |
| V2 | 2026-05-04 | Export `V2`. |
